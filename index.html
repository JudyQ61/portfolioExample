    My oldest son has Autism. Raising him has been both a challenge and a joy.  He has a degree in Sports Managment from UIndy and works with athletics at the Boys and Girls Club. He has matured so much in the last couple of years. We are so proud of him.

    My middle son has a degree Informatics from IU. He met his wife Alyssa at IU where she studied Communications. They have adopted their second rescue dog anticipating that this COVIDk-19 work-at-home time makes it a great time to train a dog.
